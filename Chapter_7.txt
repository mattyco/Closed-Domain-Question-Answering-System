ALTERNATING
CURRENT

7.1 INTRODUCTION
We have so far considered direct current (dc) sources and circuits with dc
sources. These currents do not change direction with time. But voltages
and currents that vary with time are very common. The electric mains
supply in our homes and offices is a voltage that varies like a sine function
with time. Such a voltage is called alternating voltage (ac voltage) and
the current driven by it in a circuit is called the alternating current (ac
current)*. Today, most of the electrical devices we use require ac voltage.
This is mainly because most of the electrical energy sold by power
companies is transmitted and distributed as alternating current. The main
reason for preferring use of ac voltage over dc voltage is that ac voltages
can be easily and efficiently converted from one voltage to the other by
means of transformers. Further, electrical energy can also be transmitted
economically over long distances. AC circuits exhibit characteristics which
are exploited in many devices of daily use. For example, whenever we
tune our radio to a favourite station, we are taking advantage of a special
property of ac circuits – one of many that you will study in this chapter.
* The phrases ac voltage and ac current are contradictory and redundant,
respectively, since they mean, literally, alternating current voltage and alternating
current current. Still, the abbreviation ac to designate an electrical quantity
displaying simple harmonic time dependance has become so universally accepted
that we follow others in its use. Further, voltage – another phrase commonly
used means potential difference between two points.

7.2 AC VOLTAGE APPLIED TO A RESISTOR
Figure 7.1 shows a resistor connected to a source ε of
ac voltage. The symbol for an ac source in a circuit
diagram is ~ . We consider a source which produces
sinusoidally varying potential difference across its
terminals. Let this potential difference, also called ac
voltage, be given by

where vm is the amplitude of the oscillating potential
difference and ω is its angular frequency.

1943) Yugoslov scientist,
inventor and genius. He
conceived the idea of the
rotating magnetic field,
which is the basis of
practically all alternating
current machinery, and
which helped usher in the
age of electric power. He
also invented among other
things the induction motor,
the polyphase system of ac
power, and the high
frequency induction coil
(the Tesla coil) used in radio
and television sets and
other electronic equipment.
The SI unit of magnetic field
is named in his honour.

Equation (7.3) is just Ohm’s law which for resistors works
equally well for both ac and dc voltages. The voltage across a
pure resistor and the current through it, given by Eqs. (7.1) and
(7.2) are plotted as a function of time in Fig. 7.2. Note, in
particular that both v and i reach zero, minimum and maximum
values at the same time. Clearly, the voltage and current are in
phase with each other.
We see that, like the applied voltage, the current varies
sinusoidally and has corresponding positive and negative values
during each cycle. Thus, the sum of the instantaneous current
values over one complete cycle is zero, and the average current
is zero. The fact that the average current is zero, however, does

not mean that the average power consumed is zero and
that there is no dissipation of electrical energy. As you
know, Joule heating is given by i 2R and depends on i 2
(which is always positive whether i is positive or negative)
and not on i. Thus, there is Joule heating and
dissipation of electrical energy when an
ac current passes through a resistor.
The instantaneous power dissipated in the resistor is

The average value of p over a cycle is*

Equation (7.9) gives the relation between ac current and ac voltage
and is similar to that in the dc case. This shows the advantage of
introducing the concept of rms values. In terms of rms values, the equation
for power [Eq. (7.7)] and relation between current and voltage in ac circuits
are essentially the same as those for the dc case.
It is customary to measure and specify rms values for ac quantities. For
example, the household line voltage of 220 V is an rms value with a peak
voltage of

or,

vm = 2 V = (1.414)(220 V) = 311 V
In fact, the I or rms current is the equivalent dc current that would
produce the same average power loss as the alternating current. Equation
(7.7) can also be written as
P = V2 / R = I V (since V = I R )

7.3 REPRESENTATION OF AC CURRENT AND VOLTAGE
BY ROTATING VECTORS — PHASORS
In the previous section, we learnt that the current through a resistor is
in phase with the ac voltage. But this is not so in the case of an inductor,
a capacitor or a combination of these circuit elements. In order to show
phase relationship between voltage and current
in an ac circuit, we use the notion of phasors.
The analysis of an ac circuit is facilitated by the
use of a phasor diagram. A phasor* is a vector
which rotates about the origin with angular
speed ω, as shown in Fig. 7.4. The vertical
components of phasors V and I represent the
sinusoidally varying quantities v and i. The
magnitudes of phasors V and I represent the
amplitudes or the peak values vm and im of these
oscillating quantities. Figure 7.4(a) shows the
FIGURE 7.4 (a) A phasor diagram for the
circuit in Fig 7.1. (b) Graph of v and
voltage and current phasors and their
i versus ωt.
relationship at time t1 for the case of an ac source
connected to a resistor i.e., corresponding to the
circuit shown in Fig. 7.1. The projection of
voltage and current phasors on vertical axis, i.e., vm sinωt and im sinωt,
respectively represent the value of voltage and current at that instant. As
they rotate with frequency ω, curves in Fig. 7.4(b) are generated.
From Fig. 7.4(a) we see that phasors V and I for the case of a resistor are
in the same direction. This is so for all times. This means that the phase
angle between the voltage and the current is zero.

7.4 AC VOLTAGE APPLIED

TO AN

INDUCTOR

Figure 7.5 shows an ac source connected to an inductor. Usually,
inductors have appreciable resistance in their windings, but we shall
assume that this inductor has negligible resistance.
Thus, the circuit is a purely inductive ac circuit. Let
the voltage across the source be v = vm sinωt. Using
the Kirchhoff’s loop rule,

∑ ε (t ) = 0 , and

since there

is no resistor in the circuit,

where the second term is the self-induced Faraday

FIGURE 7.5 An ac source

* Though voltage and current in ac circuit are represented by phasors – rotating
vectors, they are not vectors themselves. They are scalar quantities. It so happens
that the amplitudes and phases of harmonically varying scalars combine
mathematically in the same way as do the projections of rotating vectors of
corresponding magnitudes and directions. The rotating vectors that represent
harmonically varying scalar quantities are introduced only to provide us with a
simple way of adding these quantities using a rule that we already know.

Equation (7.11) implies that the equation for i(t), the current as a
function of time, must be such that its slope di/dt is a sinusoidally varying
quantity, with the same phase as the source voltage and an amplitude
given by vm/L. To obtain the current, we integrate di/dt with respect to
time:

The integration constant has the dimension of current and is timeindependent. Since the source has an emf which oscillates symmetrically
about zero, the current it sustains also oscillates symmetrically about
zero, so that no constant or time-independent component of the current
exists. Therefore, the integration constant is zero.

(7.14)

The dimension of inductive reactance is the same as that of resistance
and its SI unit is ohm (Ω). The inductive reactance limits the current in a
purely inductive circuit in the same way as the resistance limits the
current in a purely resistive circuit. The inductive reactance is directly
proportional to the inductance and to the frequency of the current.
A comparison of Eqs. (7.1) and (7.12) for the source voltage and the
current in an inductor shows that the current lags the voltage by π/2 or
one-quarter (1/4) cycle. Figure 7.6 (a) shows the voltage and the current
phasors in the present case at instant t1. The current phasor I is π/2
behind the voltage phasor V. When rotated with frequency ω counterclockwise, they generate the voltage and current given by Eqs. (7.1) and
(7.12), respectively and as shown in Fig. 7.6(b).

TO A

CAPACITOR

Figure 7.8 shows an ac source ε generating ac voltage v = vm sin ωt
connected to a capacitor only, a purely capacitive ac circuit.
When a capacitor is connected to a voltage source
in a dc circuit, current will flow for the short time
required to charge the capacitor. As charge
accumulates on the capacitor plates, the voltage
across them increases, opposing the current. That is,
a capacitor in a dc circuit will limit or oppose the
current as it charges. When the capacitor is fully
charged, the current in the circuit falls to zero.
When the capacitor is connected to an ac source,
as in Fig. 7.8, it limits or regulates the current, but

the current reverses each half cycle. Let q be the

The dimension of capacitive reactance is the
same as that of resistance and its SI unit is
ohm (Ω). The capacitive reactance limits the
amplitude of the current in a purely capacitive
circuit in the same way as the resistance limits
the current in a purely resistive circuit. But it
is inversely proportional to the frequency and
the capacitance.
A comparison of Eq. (7.16) with the

equation of source voltage, Eq. (7.1) shows that

the current is π/2 ahead of voltage.
Figure 7.9(a) shows the phasor diagram at an instant t1. Here the current
phasor I is π/2 ahead of the voltage phasor V as they rotate
counterclockwise. Figure 7.9(b) shows the variation of voltage and current
with time. We see that the current reaches its maximum value earlier than
the voltage by one-fourth of a period.
The instantaneous power supplied to the capacitor is
pc = i v = im cos(ωt)vm sin(ωt)

since <sin (2ωt)> = 0 over a complete cycle. Figure 7.10 explains it in detail.
Thus, we see that in the case of an inductor, the current lags the voltage
by π/2 and in the case of a capacitor, the current leads the voltage by π/2.

Example 7.3 A lamp is connected in series with a capacitor. Predict
your observations for dc and ac connections. What happens in each
case if the capacitance of the capacitor is reduced?
Solution When a dc source is connected to a capacitor, the capacitor
gets charged and after charging no current flows in the circuit and
the lamp will not glow. There will be no change even if C is reduced.
With ac source, the capacitor offers capacitative reactance (1/ω C )
and the current flows in the circuit. Consequently, the lamp will shine.
Reducing C will increase reactance and the lamp will shine less brightly
than before.

Solution As the iron rod is inserted, the magnetic field inside the coil
magnetizes the iron increasing the magnetic field inside it. Hence,
the inductance of the coil increases. Consequently, the inductive
reactance of the coil increases. As a result, a larger fraction of the
applied ac voltage appears across the inductor, leaving less voltage
across the bulb. Therefore, the glow of the light bulb decreases.

7.6.1 Phasor-diagram solution
From the circuit shown in Fig. 7.12, we see that the resistor, inductor
and capacitor are in series. Therefore, the ac current in each element is
the same at any time, having the same amplitude and phase. Let it be
(7.21)
i = im sin(ωt+φ )
where φ is the phase difference between the voltage across the source and
the current in the circuit. On the basis of what we have learnt in the previous
sections, we shall construct a phasor diagram for the present case.
Let I be the phasor representing the current in the circuit as given by
Eq. (7.21). Further, let VL, VR, VC, and V represent the voltage across the
inductor, resistor, capacitor and the source, respectively. From previous
section, we know that VR is parallel to I, VC is π/2
behind I and VL is π/2 ahead of I. VL, VR, VC and I
are shown in Fig. 7.13(a) with apppropriate phaserelations.
The length of these phasors or the amplitude
of VR, VC and VL are:
vRm = im R, vCm = im XC, vLm = im XL

(7.22)

The voltage Equation (7.20) for the circuit can
be written as
vL + vR + vC = v

(7.23)

The phasor relation whose vertical component
gives the above equation is
VL + VR + VC = V

(7.24)

FIGURE 7.13 (a) Relation between the
phasors VL, VR, VC, and I, (b) Relation
between the phasors VL, VR, and (VL + VC)
for the circuit in Fig. 7.11.

This relation is represented in Fig. 7.13(b). Since
VC and VL are always along the same line and in
opposite directions, they can be combined into a single phasor (VC + VL)
which has a magnitude ⏐vCm – vLm⏐. Since V is represented as the
hypotenuse of a right-traingle whose sides are VR and (VC + VL), the
pythagorean theorem gives:

vm2 = v Rm
+ (vCm − v Lm )

Substituting the values of vRm, vCm, and vLm from Eq. (7.22) into the above
equation, we have

Equation 7.25(a) gives the amplitude of the current and Eq. (7.27)

If XC > XL, φ is positive and the circuit is predominantly capacitive.
Consequently, the current in the circuit leads the source voltage. If
XC < X L, φ is negative and the circuit is predominantly inductive.
Consequently, the current in the circuit lags the source voltage.
Figure 7.15 shows the phasor diagram and variation of v and i with ω t
for the case XC > XL.
Thus, we have obtained the amplitude
and phase of current for an LCR series circuit
using the technique of phasors. But this
method of analysing ac circuits suffers from
certain disadvantages. First, the phasor
diagram say nothing about the initial
condition. One can take any arbitrary value
of t (say, t1, as done throughout this chapter)
and draw different phasors which show the
relative angle between different phasors.
The solution so obtained is called the
steady-state solution. This is not a general

v = 0. The general solution is the sum of the
transient solution and the steady-state
solution. After a sufficiently long time, the effects of the transient solution
die out and the behaviour of the circuit is described by the steady-state
solution.

Thus, the analytical solution for the amplitude and phase of the current
in the circuit agrees with that obtained by the technique of phasors.

7.6.3 Resonance
An interesting characteristic of the series RLC circuit is the phenomenon
of resonance. The phenomenon of resonance is common among systems
that have a tendency to oscillate at a particular frequency. This frequency
is called the system’s natural frequency. If such a system is driven by an
energy source at a frequency that is near the natural frequency, the
amplitude of oscillation is found to be large. A familiar example of this
phenomenon is a child on a swing. The the swing has a natural frequency
for swinging back and forth like a pendulum. If the child pulls on the
rope at regular intervals and the frequency of the pulls is almost the
same as the frequency of swinging, the amplitude of the swinging will be
large (Chapter 14, Class XI).
For an RLC circuit driven with voltage of amplitude vm and frequency
ω, we found that the current amplitude is given by
im =

vm

Z

with Xc = 1/ωC and XL = ω L . So if ω is varied, then at a particular frequency

(

ω0, Xc = XL, and the impedance is minimum Z = R + 0 = R . This

frequency is called the resonant frequency:
X c = X L or

or ω 0 =

1
LC

= ω0 L
ω0 C

(7.35)

At resonant frequency, the current amplitude is maximum; im = vm/R.
Figure 7.16 shows the variation of im with ω in
a RLC series circuit with L = 1.00 mH, C =
1.00 nF for two values of R: (i) R = 100 Ω
and (ii) R = 200 Ω. For the source applied vm =
⎛ 1 ⎞
100 V. ω0 for this case is ⎜⎝
⎟ = 1.00×106
LC ⎠

rad/s.
We see that the current amplitude is maximum
at the resonant frequency. Since im = vm / R at
resonance, the current amplitude for case (i) is
twice to that for case (ii).
Resonant circuits have a variety of
FIGURE 7.16 Variation of im with ω for two
applications, for example, in the tuning
cases: (i) R = 100 Ω, (ii) R = 200 Ω,
mechanism of a radio or a TV set. The antenna of
L = 1.00 mH.
a radio accepts signals from many broadcasting
stations. The signals picked up in the antenna acts as a source in the
248
tuning circuit of the radio, so the circuit can be driven at many frequencies.

Alternating Current
But to hear one particular radio station, we tune the radio. In tuning, we
vary the capacitance of a capacitor in the tuning circuit such that the
resonant frequency of the circuit becomes nearly equal to the frequency
of the radio signal received. When this happens, the amplitude of the
current with the frequency of the signal of the particular radio station in
the circuit is maximum.
It is important to note that resonance phenomenon is exhibited by a
circuit only if both L and C are present in the circuit. Only then do the
voltages across L and C cancel each other (both being out of phase)
and the current amplitude is vm/R, the total source voltage appearing
across R. This means that we cannot have resonance in a RL or RC
circuit.

Sharpness of resonance
The amplitude of the current in the series LCR circuit is given by
vm

im =

⎛
1 ⎞
R + ⎜ω L −
ω C ⎟⎠
⎝

2

2

and is maximum when ω = ω 0 = 1/ L C . The maximum value is

immax = vm / R .
For values of ω other than ω0, the amplitude of the current is less
than the maximum value. Suppose we choose a value of ω for which the
current amplitude is 1/ 2 times its maximum value. At this value, the
power dissipated by the circuit becomes half. From the curve in
Fig. (7.16), we see that there are two such values of ω, say, ω1 and ω2, one
greater and the other smaller than ω0 and symmetrical about ω0. We may
write

ω1 = ω0 + Δω
ω2 = ω0 – Δω
The difference ω1 – ω2 = 2Δω is often called the bandwidth of the circuit.
The quantity (ω0 / 2Δω) is regarded as a measure of the sharpness of
resonance. The smaller the Δω, the sharper or narrower is the resonance.
To get an expression for Δω, we note that the current amplitude im is

(1/ 2 ) i

value of Q, the smaller is the value of 2Δω or the bandwidth and sharper
is the resonance. Using ω 02 = 1/ L C , Eq. [7.36(c)] can be equivalently
expressed as Q = 1/ω0CR.
We see from Fig. 7.15, that if the resonance is less sharp, not only is
the maximum current less, the circuit is close to resonance for a larger
range Δω of frequencies and the tuning of the circuit will not be good. So,
less sharp the resonance, less is the selectivity of the circuit or vice versa.
From Eq. (7.36), we see that if quality factor is large, i.e., R is low or L is
large, the circuit is more selective.
Example 7.6 A resistor of 200 Ω and a capacitor of 15.0 μF are
connected in series to a 220 V, 50 Hz ac source. (a) Calculate the
current in the circuit; (b) Calculate the voltage (rms) across the
resistor and the capacitor. Is the algebraic sum of these voltages
more than the source voltage? If yes, resolve the paradox.
Solution
Given

R = 200 Ω, C = 15.0 μF = 15.0 × 10−6 F
V = 220 V, ν = 50 Hz
(a)
In order to calculate the current, we need the impedance of the
circuit. It is

Z = R 2 + X C2 = R 2 + (2π ν C )−2
= (200 Ω)2 + (2 × 3.14 × 50 × 10 −6 F)−2
= (200 Ω)2 + (212 Ω)2
= 291.5 Ω

Therefore, the current in the circuit is
I =

(b)

V
220 V
=
= 0.755 A
Z 291.5 Ω

Since the current is the same throughout the circuit, we have
VR = I R = (0.755 A)(200 Ω ) = 151 V
VC = I X C = (0.755 A)(212.3 Ω) = 160.3 V

The algebraic sum of the two voltages, VR and VC is 311.3 V which is
more than the source voltage of 220 V. How to resolve this paradox?
As you have learnt in the text, the two voltages are not in the same
phase. Therefore, they cannot be added like ordinary numbers. The
two voltages are out of phase by ninety degrees. Therefore, the total
of these voltages must be obtained using the Pythagorean theorem:

= 220 V
Thus, if the phase difference between two voltages is properly taken
into account, the total voltage across the resistor and the capacitor is
equal to the voltage of the source.

7.7 POWER

AC CIRCUIT: THE POWER FACTOR

We have seen that a voltage v = vm sinωt applied to a series RLC circuit
drives a current in the circuit given by i = im sin(ωt + φ) where
im =

vm
Z

⎛ X − XL ⎞
and φ = tan −1 ⎜ C
⎟⎠
⎝
R

Therefore, the instantaneous power p supplied by the source is
p = v i = (vm sin ω t ) × [im sin(ω t + φ )]
vm i m
[ cos φ − cos(2ω t + φ )]
(7.37)
2
The average power over a cycle is given by the average of the two terms in
R.H.S. of Eq. (7.37). It is only the second term which is time-dependent.
Its average is zero (the positive half of the cosine cancels the negative
half). Therefore,
=

P =

v i
vm i m
cos φ = m m cos φ
2
2 2

= V I cos φ

[7.38(a)]

This can also be written as,

P = I 2 Z cos φ

[7.38(b)]

So, the average power dissipated depends not only on the voltage and
current but also on the cosine of the phase angle φ between them. The
quantity cosφ is called the power factor. Let us discuss the following
cases:
Case (i) Resistive circuit: If the circuit contains only pure R, it is called
resistive. In that case φ = 0, cos φ = 1. There is maximum power dissipation.
Case (ii) Purely inductive or capacitive circuit: If the circuit contains
only an inductor or capacitor, we know that the phase difference between
voltage and current is π/2. Therefore, cos φ = 0, and no power is dissipated
even though a current is flowing in the circuit. This current is sometimes
referred to as wattless current.
Case (iii) LCR series circuit: In an LCR series circuit, power dissipated is
given by Eq. (7.38) where φ = tan–1 (Xc – XL )/ R. So, φ may be non-zero in
a RL or RC or RCL circuit. Even in such cases, power is dissipated only in
the resistor.

252

EXAMPLE 7.7

Case (iv) Power dissipated at resonance in LCR circuit: At resonance
Xc – XL= 0, and φ = 0. Therefore, cosφ = 1 and P = I 2Z = I 2 R. That is,
maximum power is dissipated in a circuit (through R) at resonance.
Example7.7 (a) For circuits used for transporting electric power, a
low power factor implies large power loss in transmission. Explain.
(b) Power factor can often be improved by the use of a capacitor of
appropriate capacitance in the circuit. Explain.

Alternating Current
Solution (a) We know that P = I V cosφ where cosφ is the power factor.
To supply a given power at a given voltage, if cosφ is small, we have to
increase current accordingly. But this will lead to large power loss
(I2R) in transmission.
(b)Suppose in a circuit, current I lags the voltage by an angle φ. Then
power factor cosφ =R/Z.
We can improve the power factor (tending to 1) by making Z tend to R.
Let us understand, with the help of a phasor diagram (Fig. 7.17) how
this can be achieved. Let us resolve I into two components. Ip along

FIGURE 7.17

the applied voltage V and Iq perpendicular to the applied voltage. Iq
as you have learnt in Section 7.7, is called the wattless component
since corresponding to this component of current, there is no power
loss. IP is known as the power component because it is in phase with
the voltage and corresponds to power loss in the circuit.

EXAMPLE 7.7

It’s clear from this analysis that if we want to improve power factor,
we must completely neutralize the lagging wattless current Iq by an
equal leading wattless current I′q. This can be done by connecting a
capacitor of appropriate value in parallel so that Iq and I′ q cancel
each other and P is effectively Ip V.

50 Hz is applied to a series LCR circuit in which
R = 3 Ω, L = 25.48 mH, and C = 796 μF. Find (a) the impedance of the

power factor.

at resonance is more than the power dissipated in Example 7.8.

Alternating Current
Example 7.10 At an airport, a person is made to walk through the
doorway of a metal detector, for security reasons. If she/he is carrying
anything made of metal, the metal detector emits a sound. On what
principle does this detector work?

EXAMPLE 7.10

Solution The metal detector works on the principle of resonance in
ac circuits. When you walk through a metal detector, you are,
in fact, walking through a coil of many turns. The coil is connected to
a capacitor tuned so that the circuit is in resonance. When
you walk through with metal in your pocket, the impedance of the
circuit changes – resulting in significant change in current in the
circuit. This change in current is detected and the electronic circuitry
causes a sound to be emitted as an alarm.

7.8 LC OSCILLATIONS
We know that a capacitor and an inductor can store electrical and
magnetic energy, respectively. When a capacitor (initially charged) is
connected to an inductor, the charge on the capacitor and
the current in the circuit exhibit the phenomenon of
electrical oscillations similar to oscillations in mechanical
systems (Chapter 14, Class XI).
Let a capacitor be charged qm (at t = 0) and connected
to an inductor as shown in Fig. 7.18.
The moment the circuit is completed, the charge on
the capacitor starts decreasing, giving rise to current in
the circuit. Let q and i be the charge and current in the
circuit at time t. Since di/dt is positive, the induced emf
in L will have polarity as shown, i.e., vb < va. According to
Kirchhoff’s loop rule,

oscillator. The charge, therefore, oscillates with a natural frequency
This equation has the form

ω0 =

LC
and varies sinusoidally with time as
q = qm cos ( ω 0 t + φ )

(7.41)

(7.42)

where qm is the maximum value of q and φ is a phase constant. Since
q = qm at t = 0, we have cos φ =1 or φ = 0. Therefore, in the present case,

Let us now try to visualise how this oscillation takes place in the
circuit.
Figure 7.19(a) shows a capacitor with initial charge qm connected to
an ideal inductor. The electrical energy stored in the charged capacitor is
1 qm2
. Since, there is no current in the circuit, energy in the inductor
2 C
is zero. Thus, the total energy of LC circuit is,
UE =

U = UE =

1 qm2
2 C

FIGURE 7.19 The oscillations in an LC circuit are analogous to the oscillation of a
block at the end of a spring. The figure depicts one-half of a cycle.

256

At t = 0, the switch is closed and the capacitor starts to discharge
[Fig. 7.19(b)]. As the current increases, it sets up a magnetic field in the
inductor and thereby, some energy gets stored in the inductor in the
form of magnetic energy: UB = (1/2) Li2. As the current reaches its
maximum value im, (at t = T/4) as in Fig. 7.19(c), all the energy is stored
in the magnetic field: UB = (1/2) Li2m. You can easily check that the
maximum electrical energy equals the maximum magnetic energy. The
capacitor now has no charge and hence no energy. The current now
starts charging the capacitor, as in Fig. 7.19(d). This process continues
till the capacitor is fully charged (at t = T/2) [Fig. 7.19(e)]. But it is charged
with a polarity opposite to its initial state in Fig. 7.19(a). The whole process
just described will now repeat itself till the system reverts to its original
state. Thus, the energy in the system oscillates between the capacitor
and the inductor.

Alternating Current
The LC oscillation is similar to the mechanical oscillation of a block
attached to a spring. The lower part of each figure in Fig. 7.19 depicts
the corresponding stage of a mechanical system (a block attached to a
spring). As noted earlier, for a block of a mass m oscillating with frequency
ω0, the equation is
d2 x
+ ω 20 x = 0
dt 2
Here, ω 0 = k / m , and k is the spring constant. So, x corresponds to q.
In case of a mechanical system F = ma = m (dv/dt) = m (d2x/dt2 ). For an
electrical system, ε = –L (di/dt ) = –L (d2q/dt 2 ). Comparing these two
equations, we see that L is analogous to mass m: L is a measure of
resistance to change in current. In case of LC circuit, ω 0 = 1/ LC and
for mass on a spring, ω 0 = k / m . So, 1/C is analogous to k. The constant
k (=F/x) tells us the (external) force required to produce a unit
displacement whereas 1/C (=V/q ) tells us the potential difference required
to store a unit charge. Table 7.1 gives the analogy between mechanical
and electrical quantities.

Note that the above discussion of LC oscillations is not realistic for two
reasons:
(i) Every inductor has some resistance. The effect of this resistance is to
introduce a damping effect on the charge and current in the circuit
and the oscillations finally die away.
(ii) Even if the resistance were zero, the total energy of the system would
not remain constant. It is radiated away from the system in the form
of electromagnetic waves (discussed in the next chapter). In fact, radio
and TV transmitters depend on this radiation.

perfect match.
You will come across numerous such situations in physics where diverse physical
phenomena are represented by the same mathematical equation. If you have dealt with
one of them, and you come across another situation, you may simply replace the
corresponding quantities and interpret the result in the new context. We suggest that
you may try to find more such parallel situations from different areas of physics. One
must, of course, be aware of the differences too.

7.9 TRANSFORMERS
For many purposes, it is necessary to change (or transform) an alternating
voltage from one to another of greater or smaller value. This is done with
a device called transformer using the principle of mutual induction.
A transformer consists of two sets of coils, insulated from each other.
They are wound on a soft-iron core, either one on top of the other as in
Fig. 7.20(a) or on separate limbs of the core as in Fig. 7.20(b). One of the
coils called the primary coil has Np turns. The other coil is called the
secondary coil; it has Ns turns. Often the primary coil is the input coil
and the secondary coil is the output coil of the transformer.

259

Physics

FIGURE 7.20 Two arrangements for winding of primary and secondary coil in a transformer:
(a) two coils on top of each other, (b) two coils on separate limbs of the core.

When an alternating voltage is applied to the primary, the resulting
current produces an alternating magnetic flux which links the secondary
and induces an emf in it. The value of this emf depends on the number of
turns in the secondary. We consider an ideal transformer in which the
primary has negligible resistance and all the flux in the core links both
primary and secondary windings. Let φ be the flux in each turn in the
core at time t due to current in the primary when a voltage vp is applied
to it.
Then the induced emf or voltage εs, in the secondary with Ns turns is
dφ
(7.45)
dt
The alternating flux φ also induces an emf, called back emf in the
primary. This is

εs = − N s

dφ
(7.46)
dt
But εp = vp. If this were not so, the primary current would be infinite
since the primary has zero resistance(as assumed). If the secondary is
an open circuit or the current taken from it is small, then to a good
approximation
εs = vs
where vs is the voltage across the secondary. Therefore, Eqs. (7.45) and
(7.46) can be written as

ε p = −N p

vs = − N s

Alternating Current
Note that the above relation has been obtained using three
assumptions: (i) the primary resistance and current are small; (ii) the
same flux links both the primary and the secondary as very little flux
escapes from the core, and (iii) the secondary current is small.
If the transformer is assumed to be 100% efficient (no energy losses),
the power input is equal to the power output, and since p = i v,
(7.48)
ipvp = isvs
Although some energy is always lost, this is a good approximation,
since a well designed transformer may have an efficiency of more than
95%. Combining Eqs. (7.47) and (7.48), we have
i p vs
N
=
= s
(7.49)
i
v
N

p

p

Since i and v both oscillate with the same frequency as the ac source,
Eq. (7.49) also gives the ratio of the amplitudes or rms values of
corresponding quantities.
Now, we can see how a transformer affects the voltage and current.
We have:
⎛N ⎞
⎛ Np ⎞
Vs = ⎜ s ⎟ V p and I s = ⎜
Ip
(7.50)
⎝ N s ⎟⎠
⎝ Np ⎠
That is, if the secondary coil has a greater number of turns than the
primary (Ns > Np), the voltage is stepped up(Vs > Vp). This type of
arrangement is called a step-up transformer. However, in this arrangement,
there is less current in the secondary than in the primary (Np/Ns < 1 and Is
< Ip). For example, if the primary coil of a transformer has 100 turns and
the secondary has 200 turns, Ns/Np = 2 and Np/Ns=1/2. Thus, a 220V
input at 10A will step-up to 440 V output at 5.0 A.
If the secondary coil has less turns than the primary(Ns < Np), we have
a step-down transformer. In this case, Vs < Vp and Is > Ip. That is, the
voltage is stepped down, or reduced, and the current is increased.
The equations obtained above apply to ideal transformers (without
any energy losses). But in actual transformers, small energy losses do
occur due to the following reasons:
(i) Flux Leakage: There is always some flux leakage; that is, not all of
the flux due to primary passes through the secondary due to poor
design of the core or the air gaps in the core. It can be reduced by
winding the primary and secondary coils one over the other.
(ii) Resistance of the windings: The wire used for the windings has some
resistance and so, energy is lost due to heat produced in the wire
(I 2R). In high current, low voltage windings, these are minimised by
using thick wire.
(iii) Eddy currents: The alternating magnetic flux induces eddy currents
in the iron core and causes heating. The effect is reduced by having a
laminated core.
(iv) Hysteresis: The magnetisation of the core is repeatedly reversed by
the alternating magnetic field. The resulting expenditure of energy in
the core appears as heat and is kept to a minimum by using a magnetic
material which has a low hysteresis loss.

261

Physics
The large scale transmission and distribution of electrical energy over
long distances is done with the use of transformers. The voltage output
of the generator is stepped-up (so that current is reduced and
consequently, the I 2R loss is cut down). It is then transmitted over long
distances to an area sub-station near the consumers. There the voltage
is stepped down. It is further stepped down at distributing sub-stations
and utility poles before a power supply of 240 V reaches our homes.

SUMMARY
1.

An alternating voltage v = vm sin ω t applied to a resistor R drives a
current i = im sinωt in the resistor, i m =

2.

vm
. The current is in phase with
R

the applied voltage.
For an alternating current i = im sinωt passing through a resistor R, the
average power loss P (averaged over a cycle) due to joule heating is
( 1/2 )i 2mR. To express it in the same form as the dc power (P = I 2R), a
special value of current is used. It is called root mean square (rms)
current and is donoted by I:

I =

= 0.707 im

Similarly, the rms voltage is defined by

V =

ωC is called capacitive reactance.

The current through the capacitor is π/2 ahead of the applied voltage.
As in the case of inductor, the average power supplied to a capacitor
over one complete cycle is zero.
For a series RLC circuit driven by voltage v = vm sinωt, the current is
given by i = im sin (ωt + φ )
where

im =

and φ = tan −1

Z =

We have P = IV = I 2R
An ac voltage v = vm sinωt applied to a pure inductor L, drives a current
in the inductor i = im sin (ωt – π/2), where im = vm/XL. XL = ωL is called
inductive reactance. The current in the inductor lags the voltage by
π/2. The average power supplied to an inductor over one complete cycle
is zero.
An ac voltage v = vm sinωt applied to a capacitor drives a current in the
capacitor: i = im sin (ωt + π/2). Here,

im =

Alternating Current
The average power loss over a complete cycle is given by
P = V I cosφ
The term cosφ is called the power factor.
6.

7.

8.

In a purely inductive or capacitive circuit, cosφ = 0 and no power is
dissipated even though a current is flowing in the circuit. In such cases,
current is referred to as a wattless current.
The phase relationship between current and voltage in an ac circuit
can be shown conveniently by representing voltage and current by
rotating vectors called phasors. A phasor is a vector which rotates
about the origin with angular speed ω. The magnitude of a phasor
represents the amplitude or peak value of the quantity (voltage or
current) represented by the phasor.
The analysis of an ac circuit is facilitated by the use of a phasor
diagram.
An interesting characteristic of a series RLC circuit is the
phenomenon of resonance. The circuit exhibits resonance, i.e.,
the amplitude of the current is maximum at the resonant
frequency, ω 0 =

Q=

. The quality factor Q defined by
LC
is an indicator of the sharpness of the resonance,

the higher value of Q indicating sharper peak in the current.
A circuit containing an inductor L and a capacitor C (initially
charged) with no ac source and no resistors exhibits free
oscillations. The charge q of the capacitor satisfies the equation
of simple harmonic motion:

d2 q

+
q=0
dt 2 LC
and therefore, the frequency ω of free oscillation is ω 0 =

1
. The
LC

energy in the system oscillates between the capacitor and the
inductor but their sum or the total energy is constant in time.
10. A transformer consists of an iron core on which are bound a
primary coil of N p turns and a secondary coil of N s turns. If the
primary coil is connected to an ac source, the primary and
secondary voltages are related by

⎛N ⎞
Vs = ⎜ s ⎟ V p
⎝ Np ⎠
and the currents are related by

⎛ Np
Is = ⎜
⎝ Ns

⎞
⎟⎠ I p

If the secondary coil has a greater number of turns than the primary, the
voltage is stepped-up (Vs > Vp). This type of arrangement is called a stepup transformer. If the secondary coil has turns less than the primary, we
have a step-down transformer.

POINTS TO PONDER
1.

When a value is given for ac voltage or current, it is ordinarily the rms
value. The voltage across the terminals of an outlet in your room is
normally 240 V. This refers to the rms value of the voltage. The amplitude
of this voltage is

vm = 2V = 2(240) = 340 V
2.

264

The power rating of an element used in ac circuits refers to its average
power rating.

3.

The power consumed in an circuit is never negative.

4.

Both alternating current and direct current are measured in amperes.
But how is the ampere defined for an alternating current? It cannot be
derived from the mutual attraction of two parallel wires carrying ac
currents, as the dc ampere is derived. An ac current changes direction

Alternating Current
with the source frequency and the attractive force would average to
zero. Thus, the ac ampere must be defined in terms of some property
that is independent of the direction of the current. Joule heating
is such a property, and there is one ampere of rms value of
alternating current in a circuit if the current produces the same
average heating effect as one ampere of dc current would produce
under the same conditions.
5.

In an ac circuit, while adding voltages across different elements, one
should take care of their phases properly. For example, if VR and VC
are voltages across R and C, respectively in an RC circuit, then the
total voltage across RC combination is VRC =

VR2 + VC2

and not

VR + VC since VC is π/2 out of phase of VR.
6.

Though in a phasor diagram, voltage and current are represented by
vectors, these quantities are not really vectors themselves. They are
scalar quantities. It so happens that the amplitudes and phases of
harmonically varying scalars combine mathematically in the same
way as do the projections of rotating vectors of corresponding
magnitudes and directions. The ‘rotating vectors’ that represent
harmonically varying scalar quantities are introduced only to provide
us with a simple way of adding these quantities using a rule that
we already know as the law of vector addition.

7.

There are no power losses associated with pure capacitances and pure
inductances in an ac circuit. The only element that dissipates energy
in an ac circuit is the resistive element.

8.

In a RLC circuit, resonance phenomenon occur when X L = X C or

ω0 =

1
. For resonance to occur, the presence of both L and C
LC

elements in the circuit is a must. With only one of these (L or C )
elements, there is no possibility of voltage cancellation and hence,
no resonance is possible.
9.

The power factor in a RLC circuit is a measure of how close the
circuit is to expending the maximum power.

10. In generators and motors, the roles of input and output are
reversed. In a motor, electric energy is the input and mechanical
energy is the output. In a generator, mechanical energy is the
input and electric energy is the output. Both devices simply
transform energy from one form to another.
11. A transformer (step-up) changes a low-voltage into a high-voltage.
This does not violate the law of conservation of energy. The
current is reduced by the same proportion.
12. The choice of whether the description of an oscillatory motion is
by means of sines or cosines or by their linear combinations is
unimportant, since changing the zero-time position transforms
the one to the other.
