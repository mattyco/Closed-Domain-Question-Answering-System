These currents do not change direction with time. But voltages and currents that vary with time are very common. The electric mains supply in our homes and offices is a voltage that varies like a sine function with time. Such a voltage is called alternating voltage (ac voltage) and the current driven by it in a circuit is called the alternating current (ac current)*. Today, most of the electrical devices we use require ac voltage. This is mainly because most of the electrical energy sold by power companies is transmitted and distributed as alternating current. The main reason for preferring use of ac voltage over dc voltage is that ac voltages can be easily and efficiently converted from one voltage to the other by means of transformers. Further, electrical energy can also be transmitted economically over long distances. AC circuits exhibit characteristics which are exploited in many devices of daily use. For example, whenever we tune our radio to a favourite station, we are taking advantage of a special property of ac circuits \u00e2\u0080\u0093 one of many that you will study in this chapter. * The phrases ac voltage and ac current are contradictory and redundant, respectively, since they mean, literally, alternating current voltage and alternating current current. Still, the abbreviation ac to designate an electrical quantity displaying simple harmonic time dependance has become so universally accepted that we follow others in its use.

VL, VR, VC and I are shown in Fig. 7.13(a) with apppropriate phaserelations.

Since V is represented as the hypotenuse of a right-traingle whose sides are VR and (VC + VL), the pythagorean theorem gives: 2 vm2 = v Rm + (vCm \u00e2\u0088\u0092 v Lm )", "qas": []}, {"context": "Using Eq.

Thus, we have obtained the amplitude and phase of current for an LCR series circuit using the technique of phasors. But this method of analysing ac circuits suffers from certain disadvantages. First, the phasor diagram say nothing about the initial condition. One can take any arbitrary value of t (say, t1, as done throughout this chapter) and draw different phasors which show the relative angle between different phasors.

Further, in Chapter 6, we have seen that a magnetic field changing with time gives rise to an electric field. Is the converse also true? Does an electric field changing with time give rise to a magnetic field? James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1879), argued that this was indeed the case \u00e2\u0080\u0093 not only an electric current but also a time-varying electric field generates magnetic field. While applying the Ampere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s circuital law to find magnetic field at a point outside a capacitor connected to a time-varying current, Maxwell noticed an inconsistency in the Ampere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s circuital law. He suggested the existence of an additional current, called by him, the displacement current to remove this inconsistency. Maxwell formulated a set of equations involving electric and magnetic fields, and their sources, the charge and current densities. These equations are known as Maxwell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s equations. Together with the Lorentz force formula (Chapter 4), they mathematically express all the basic laws of electromagnetism. The most important prediction to emerge from Maxwell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s equations is the existence of electromagnetic waves, which are (coupled) timevarying electric and magnetic fields that propagate in space.

This effect is of great importance because it explains the existence of radio waves, gamma rays and visible light, as well as all other forms of electromagnetic waves.

For this, we consider a plane circular loop of radius r whose plane is perpendicular to the direction of the current-carrying wire, and which is centred symmetrically with respect to the wire [Fig. 8.1(a)]. From symmetry, the magnetic field is directed along the circumference of the circular loop and is the same in magnitude at all points on the loop so that if B is the magnitude of the field, the left side of Eq. (8.1) is B (2\u00cf\u0080 r). So we have B (2\u00cf\u0080r) = \u00ce\u00bc0i (t )", "qas": []}, {"context": "Electromagnetic Waves Now, consider a different surface, which has the same boundary. This is a pot like surface [Fig. 8.1(b)] which nowhere touches the current, but has its bottom between the capacitor plates; its mouth is the circular loop mentioned above. Another such surface is shaped like a tiffin box (without the lid) [Fig. 8.1(c)]. On applying Ampere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s circuital law to such surfaces with the same perimeter, we find that the left hand side of Eq.

The missing term must be such that one gets the same magnetic field at point P, no matter what surface is used. We can actually guess the missing term by looking carefully at Fig. 8.1(c). Is there anything passing through the surface S between the plates of the capacitor? Yes, of course, the electric field! If the plates of the capacitor have an area A, and a total charge Q, the magnitude of the electric field E between the plates is (Q/A)/\u00ce\u00b50 (see Eq. 2.41).

The word magnet is derived from the name of an island in Greece called magnesia where magnetic ore deposits were found, as early as 600 BC. Shepherds on this island complained that their wooden shoes (which had nails) at times stayed struck to the ground. Their iron-tipped rods were similarly affected. This attractive property of magnets made it difficult for them to move around. The directional property of magnets was also known since ancient times. A thin long piece of a magnet, when suspended freely, pointed in the north-south direction. A similar effect was observed when it was placed on a piece of cork which was then allowed to float in still water. The name lodestone (or loadstone) given to a naturally occurring ore of ironmagnetite means leading stone. The technological exploitation of this property is generally credited to the Chinese. Chinese texts dating 400 BC mention the use of magnetic needles for navigation on ships. Caravans crossing the Gobi desert also employed magnetic needles.

The notion of field elegantly accounts for the time delay.

This system is unchanged if (a) translated parallel to the y-z plane in any direction, (b) rotated about the x-axis through any angle. As the system is unchanged under such symmetry operation, so must its properties be. In particular, in this example, the electric field E must be unchanged. Translation symmetry along the y-axis shows that the electric field must be the same at a point (0, y1, 0) as at (0, y2, 0). Similarly translational symmetry along the z-axis shows that the electric field at two point (0, 0, z1) and (0, 0, z2) must be the same. By using rotation symmetry around the x-axis, we can conclude that E must be perpendicular to the y-z plane, that is, it must be parallel to the x-direction.

During a lecture demonstration in the summer of 1820, the Danish physicist Hans Christian Oersted noticed that a current in a straight wire caused a noticeable deflection in a nearby magnetic compass needle. He investigated this phenomenon. He found that the alignment of the needle is tangential to an imaginary circle which has the straight wire as its centre and has its plane perpendicular to the wire. This situation is depicted in Fig.4.1(a). It is noticeable when the current is large and the needle sufficiently close to the wire so that the earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s magnetic field may be ignored. Reversing the direction of the current reverses the orientation of the needle [Fig. 4.1(b)]. The deflection increases on increasing the current or bringing the needle closer to the wire. Iron filings sprinkled around the wire arrange themselves in concentric circles with the wire as the centre [Fig. 4.1(c)].
